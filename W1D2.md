Welcome to HTML! I'm excited to get to know you and see the progress you make on your Finstagram apps.Today we covered the basics on how to properly structure our app.

We talked about how every web page is made up of a series of boxes. We call these **elements**. Some common HTML elements are `<main>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`. (Check out http://html5doctor.com/ ) for a full list. Some of these tags require a closing tag (like `<p>some paragraph text</p>` ) while others are self closing ( `<img src='http://example.com/image.jpg'>`).

Elements can accept **attributes** to give us some more information about the element. For example, anchor (link) tags will accept a `href` attribute that tells us what link to open when the user clicks the element. Take `<a href="http://www.google.com">Click Here</a> to visit Google`. When some clicks the "Click Here" text, their browser would open the Google homepage.

Many elements have default styling attached to them by the browser. A `<h1>` element is, by default, a larger font size and weight. (Next week, we'll look at how we can override these default styles with our own CSS).

Our HTML pages are structured like this:

```
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `<html>` element wraps everything. The `<head>` element contains some information about our page like the title and links to external assets. The `<body>` contains all of the visible elements on the page, like those `<article>`, `<header>` etc. tags.

Pay attention to the indentation! Anytime you nest something inside tags, tab it over one time. This will make your code readable to instructors when we help you out, but more importantly it will make it easier for YOU to spot bugs and add new features.
