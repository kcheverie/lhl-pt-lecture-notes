For the past few classes we've been manually entering data using tux, which has gotten old fast. We want a better, more dynamic way of interacting with our application - to do this, we use forms.

This is what a html form looks like:
```
<form action="/books" method="POST">
  <label for="title">Title</label>
  <input type="text" name="title" id="title" />

  <label for="author">Author</label>
  <input type="text" name="author" id="author" />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Each form has a *method* and an *action* that is triggered when the form is submitted.


## Input Fields
Input fields have a *type* attribute (password, email, or text) which specifies what kind of input they take. This is useful for hiding passwords or making sure your users enter a proper email address. Remember though, this is only our client side validation, meaning if we use type="email, a user won't be able to enter an email that doesn't include an @ sign, but if you use type="text", a user will be able to enter empty values without back-end validation (which we also looked at, and there's notes at the end of this email)

Input fields also have a name which we will use to access the data from the Sinatra side. Your name="value" in your form is what Sinatra will grab in actions.rb with the params[:value] code.

## The Button
... is of the type submit, which means when it's clicked the form is submitted (AKA it performs the action and method). Keep in mind, your submit button will of course "submit" your form, but it is essential that the button is within the <form> element itself, otherwise it won't know which form to submit!

## The Method
We have a <form> tag which has an ACTION (where this data is going) and a METHOD (what we're doing with the data).

The two methods we discussed were GET (retrieving data, like a search field, or showing the form to the user) and POST (sending data, like a login form or creating a profile).

## The Action
Once we submit the form, Sinatra looks for a block inside actions.rb that matches the METHOD and ACTION.

Since our method here is "post" and our action is "/books", it will look for something like this:
```
post "/books" do
  # code inside here will be run!
end
```
## Params (short for parameters)
Not only will Sinatra run the code inside the block, it will give us a variable called params, which is a Ruby hash.

The params hash stores all the data from our form, with the name of each input being the key, and the input's data as the value.

In English, that means we can do the following:
```
post "/books" do
  title = params[:title]
  author = params[:author]
end
```
We now store the data from the form inside variables for later use.

## Saving the Data
```
post "/books" do
  title = params[:title]
  author = params[:author]
  book = Book.new({ title: title, author: author })
  if book.save
     # redirect to the list of books
  else
     # show the new book form again, this time with errors
  end
end
```
Now we take our variables and use them to make a new Book model.

We then try to save that model. If it works, the user is redirected to the homepage. Otherwise, we show them the form again, so they can try again.

But why would our saving fail?

## Validations
We want to make sure our user gives our book both a title and an author.

To do that, we modify models/book.rb.
```
class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :library
  validates_presence_of :title, :author
  validates_uniqueness_of :id, :author
end
```
Now our book model validates the presence of both author and title. If we try to save the book without BOTH of those fields, the save will fail, and the user will be shown the form again.
