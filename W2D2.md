Today we introduced Relational databases, what they are, and how we use ActiveRecord to interact with them!

#### What is a database?
If you've ever used spreadsheet software, like Excel (on windows) or Numbers (for Mac), then this concept should be familiar. Each table is like a sheet. We labelled our columns across the top, and then each row represents an object or record in the table.

Databases work the same, utilizing tables, columns and rows to represent the data we want to store.

#### Relational Databases
Lets say we have a users table and a posts table. We know that our favourite user, Mr.Sharky_J has made a bunch of posts, and we want to display them. How will we know which posts in the table belong to him?

By adding a `user_id` field to our posts table, we can connect our user to his posts.

#### CRUD!
The four main actions that our database must perform are:

- `Create` - insert a new row into a table
- `Read` - pull the record from the table
- `Update` - edit the record and apply new values in 1 or more columns
- `Destroy` - Remove the record from the table

We can perform all these tasks with our new tool...

#### In ActiveRecord
An ORM (Object Relational Mapper). It acts like a bridge between our apps and our database.

To use ActiveRecord in the command line (bash), run bundle exec tux. This will start tux, a small program which is ready to accept our ActiveRecord commands and let us interact with our data.

Heres a cheat sheet for ActiveRecord commands (using the User model as an example):

```ruby
# Create
User.create(username: "Guy Fantastico", avatar_url: "www.fantastico.com/photo")
# OR
user = User.new
user.username = "Guy Fantastico"
user.avatar_url = "www.fantastico.com/photo"
user.save
```

```ruby
# Read
User.all # Returns all users
User.find_by(username: "Guy Fantastico") # Returns the first user that matches the username. You can find_by any column in the table.

User.first # Returns the first user
User.last # Returns the last user
```
```ruby
# Update
user = User.first
user.update(username: "Guy Regular") # Updates the record to the new value
```

```ruby
# Destroy
user = User.find_by(username: "Guy Regular") 
user.destroy # Deletes the user
```

#### SQL tutorial
Here is some of the SQL that we went through in class and how you would write of it in ActiveRecord.

- Get all users:

    ```sql
    -- In SQL
    SELECT * FROM users;
    ```

    ```ruby
    # In ActiveRecord
    User.all
    ```

- Get all Comments where `user_id` is 4

    ```sql
    -- In SQL
    SELECT * FROM comments
    WHERE user_id = 4;
    ```
    
    ```ruby
    # In ActiveRecord
    Comment.where(user_id: 4)
    ```
    
- Get all comments sorted by their created_at date in descending order

    ```sql
    -- In SQL
    SELECT  * FROM comments
    ORDER BY created_at DESC;
    ```
    
    ```ruby
    # In ActiveRecord
    Comment.order(created_at: :desc)
    ```

- Get all user's usernames and their comment's text and order them by the username (reverse alphabetical)

    ```sql
    -- In SQL
    SELECT
        users.username,
        comments.text
    FROM users
    JOIN comments ON users.id = comments.user_id
    ORDER BY users.username DESC;
    ```
    
    ```ruby
    # In ActiveRecord
    User.select(:username, :text).joins(:comments).order(:username)
    ```

Here are this week's slides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A-7KrXpVJj8vy4a8pJEPYrvm54DJw29RJ9ZKh-S5hqA/edit?usp=sharing

I would highly recommend going through some of activities in the Resources list. They're super helpful in further exploring SQL and ActiveRecord.

Also these are some good resources that explains SQL joins if you're curious: https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/
https://www.zmwolski.com/stop-guessing-sql-joins-explained

If you have a chance, https://pgexercises.com/ is also a great SQL resource.

See you next week!
