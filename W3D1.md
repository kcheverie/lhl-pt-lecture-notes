Hey part-timers! Today we learned how to apply our Ruby knowledge to our exising HTML documents.

## Loops
First of all though, we were introduced to a new concept - **looping**. We use loops to keep our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

A loop looks like this:

```
(1..10).each do |n|
  puts n
end
```
this will output something that looks like this:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## ERB
We can use Ruby codes in our HTML by using ERB files - ERB stands for Embedded Ruby.

First, we declare an instance variable for our user in our actions.rb and tell it which erb file to use.
```
get '/' do
  @user = {name: "Bob", email: "bob@gmail.com"}
  erb :index
end
```

Then, in index.erb we use alligator tags with an equals sign to display a value
```
<p>
  Hello <%= @user[:name]%>!
</p>
```

This will return a HTML page with a paragraph that says "Hello Bob!"

We can also use our new knowledge about loops to easily display many values in our HTML.
```
get '/' do
  @user1 = {name: "Bob", email: "bob@gmail.com"}
    @user2 = {name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@gmail.com"}
    @user3 = {name: "Alex", email: "alex@gmail.com"}
    @users = [@user1, @user2, @user3]
  erb :index
end
```

in our index.erb, we use alligator tags again for our logic, but this time without an equals sign
```
<ul>
  <% @users.each do |user| %>
      <li>
        <%= user[:name] %> (<%= user.email%>)
      </li>
  <% end %>
<ul>
```

This will return us a list of all users and their emails, like this:
* Bob (bob@gmail.com)
* Sarah (sarah@gmail.com)
* Alex (alex@gmail.com)

In our Finstagram app we have a lot of elements that get re-used on all pages through the app - things like headers, footers, and links to our styles. In the spirit of keeping our code DRY, Sinatra has a layout.erb file we can use for all our repeated elements. We just use the `yield` keyword to display the content for the specific page

layout.erb
```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/application.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>Finstagram</header>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>

```

You're making great progress with your Finstagram apps! Here's a link to the slides for today. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zsZKUaYb_k1YfGHnpEFCP-3kTkWensofjvQeQKcjNsM/edit?usp=sharing See you next week!
