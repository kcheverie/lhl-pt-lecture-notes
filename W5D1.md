Today we learned how to keep track of our users across visits to our application.

The problem we have is that HTTP is stateless - every single request acts is as if it's coming from a completely new client. This poses a problem when keep some information in state, like a user's online shopping cart or a logged in state.

Sessions to the rescue! When sessions are enabled in Sinatra, a hexadecimal string of digits called the session ID is passed along with every request and response between the server and client. On the client side, the ID is stored in a browser cookie. When the client makes a request, it sends the session ID alongside all the other relevant data. Sinatra then uses the session ID to find the correct session hash, which stores whatever data the application developer decided is important.

To log in to our app, first we'll need a form:

```
# login.erb
<form action="/login" method="post">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="text" name="email" value="<%= @user.email %>">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="password">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

Then, we need a way to add the current user to the Sinatra session hash
```
# actions.rb

# displays login form
get '/login' do
    erb(:login)
end

# create current_user
post '/login' do
  @user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
  if @user.password == params[:password]
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect '/'
  else
    erb(:login)
  end
end
```

To log a user out of the application, we simply clear the ID from the session hash

```
# actions.rb

get '/logout'
  session[:user_id] = nil
  redirect '/'
do
```

To keep track of whether or not a user is logged in throughout the app, we user helper methods that are accessible to any view.

```
# actions.rb

helpers do
  def current_user
    User.find_by(session[:user_id])
  end
end

```


On Thursday we'll learn about partials, another way to keep our code DRY, and RESTful routing.
