RESTful routes and partials

Today we tackled a common convention for creating routes in our application, and looked at how we can re-use parts of our views to keep our code DRY

REST (stands for REpresentational State Transfer) is an architechtural pattern for naming our routes based on the apps resources. Finstagram has finstagram-posts, comments, likes and users. Our RESTful routes look like this

```
HTTP method   route             action
-----------   -----             ------
GET           'posts'           shows a list of all our posts
GET           'posts/new'       shows a form for creating a new post
POST          'posts'           creates a new post
GET           'posts/:id'       shows a single post
GET           'posts/:id/edit'  shows a form to edit a single post
PUT           'posts/:id'       updates a single post
DELETE        'posts/:id'       deletes a single post

```

The `:id` in these routes is what we call a wildcard - we can put anything we want in that place and access it through the params hash.

```
get 'posts/:id' do
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  erb(:'posts/show')
end
```
If we type the route `posts/27` in our browser, our action will recognize 27 as the value for the `id` wildcard and we can search our posts to find the one with that ID.

Partials are pieces of our views that we want to re-use throughout the application. Our application may have many forms, and on those forms we want to display errors if it hasn't been submitted correctly.

errors.erb
```
  <ul class="errors">
    <% error_messages.each do |error| %>
      <li><%= errors %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
```

in our 'signup.erb' view, we can render the partial like this and pass it the errors for that form
`<%= erb(:errors, { locals: { error_messages: @user.errors.full_messages } }) %>`
