Welcome to Intro to Web! I'm excited to get to know you all over the next six weeks and see the progress you make with your web apps.

We covered quite a few topics today to give you a general overview of what to expect from the course.

We talked about the difference between a **website** and a **web application** - websites are just static content, and they're becoming less and less common. Web applications are rich interfaces with a lot of interaction from the user. Think of something like Facebook - you can create an account, interact with other accounts, and create your own content. In this course, you'll be creating a web application.

There are 4 components of a web application:

**the front end** - HTML/CSS/Javascript - this is what the user sees

**the back end** - Ruby/Sinatra/Rails - receives data from the front end and sents it to the server

**database** - stores organized data

**infrastructure** - where your application is hosted

**Full stack** developers work with and are familiar with all of these components of a web applications, where a **specialist** developer is only concerned with one or two of them.

Our files for this course are stored on the **Cloud** - this just means that they are stored somewhere else, not on our computers.

Developers use **version control** to work on the same project (repository). It makes it easy to see the history of a project and revert back to an earlier version if necessary. The version control system we use is called git, and it's stored in the cloud on **Github**.

On Thursday you'll be setting up your Cloud9 environment and start coding! If you want a head start on HTML, take a look at Codecademy https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html Here is a link to the slides for today:
