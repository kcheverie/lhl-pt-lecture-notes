**CSS** stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. It's how we change the look and feel of our HTML markup.

A CSS Rule consists of selector, a property and a value. It looks like this:

```
selector {
  property: value;
}

```

The **selector** is the element we want to style (such as "h1"). The **property** is one aspect of the element we want to change ("color") and the **value** is the value of that property ("red");

Our browsers come with some basic styling for elements, but we usually want to override these with our own styles. To do this, we create a `.css` file and link it in the `<head>` of our HTML file like this:

```
<head>
  <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”>
</head>
```

There are a few different ways we can select an element.

This will select all `<p>` tags
```
p {...}
```

This will select all `<p>` tags nested inside an `<article>` tag

```
article p {...}
```

We can get even more specific and select by class or ID. This is how we would select the following elements in CSS.

```
<p class="first">first paragraph</p>
<p id="second">second paragraph</p>

.first {...}
#second {...}
```

There are way too many CSS properties to memorize (checkout [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) reference), but there are a few you will probably use a lot, like `display`, `padding`, `margin`, `color`, `font-size` and `border`.

Get friendly with the Chrome Inspector when you're working on CSS - it's the best way to debug and try out styles before commiting them to your code!
